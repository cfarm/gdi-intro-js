## Every class

1. Update class1 ice breaker
1. Update/confirm class survey link 

## Improvements

- remove animations
- add toc
- introduce DOM earlier in class 2, add more practice with it, practical exercises, visual exercises, updating the dom with events etc
  - can we get through all the data types (including objects) in day 1 and spend day 2 on dom manipulation/events? remove extraneous content from day 1 and test it out.
